# Rosen-CEAUG
![Preview Image](About/Preview.png "Preview")

## Which?
Currently the A1.
I will probably do the A3 as a seperate style or as a random graphic variant.

## Why?
[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnDKZRfmCd4) video by 
Atelier, which happens to be the source of the preview image that got you to click this, was the primary reason I made this.  I just thought the gun looked really cool and I always wanted to take the chance to try making guns for CE.

## Who?
I did the code.
The graphics and sounds are from [Nigel G. Ripper's](https://steamcommunity.com/id/zodrazactual) [Zardoz Armory II](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2778703069).
The thumbnail is a screenshot from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnDKZRfmCd4) video by Atelier, as previously mentioned.  I just want to make it clear I have no talent in creating visual arts.


### But what about vanilla?
Go install [VE Weapons](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1814383360).  It's called the "carbine."  It even comes with multiple ideological styles.
