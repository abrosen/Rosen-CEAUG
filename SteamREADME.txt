[h1]Which?[/h1]
Currently the A1.
I will probably do the A3 as a seperate style or as a random graphic variant.

[h1]Why?[/h1]
[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnDKZRfmCd4]This[/url] video by Atelier, which happens to be the source of the preview image that got you to click this, was the primary reason I made this.  I just thought the gun looked really cool and I always wanted to take the chance to try making guns for CE.

[h1]Who?[/h1]
I did the code.
The graphics and sounds are from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/zodrazactual]Nigel G. Ripper's[/url] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2778703069]Zardoz Armory II[/url].
The thumbnail is a screenshot from [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnDKZRfmCd4]this[/url] video by Atelier, as previously mentioned.  I just want to make it clear I have no talent in creating visual arts.

[h1]But what about vanilla?[/h1]
Go install [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1814383360]VE Weapons[/url].  It's called the "carbine."  It even comes with multiple ideological styles.
